## Apple Pay and Apple Wallet

For the uninitiated, **Apple Pay** allows you to make easy, secure, and private transactions in stores, in apps, and on the web. 

**Apple Wallet** on the otherhand is an app on iPhone and Apple Watch that securely and conveniently organizes your transit passes, boarding passes, tickets, rewards cards, and more â€” all in one place.

But here on the *Philippines*, even though our payment terminals support **Apple Pay** and other payment methods through NFC, our local banks doesn't support adding our local payment methods (Credit and Debit Cards) inside our **Apple Wallet**.

Fortunately, there has been a workaround for this, and this will be the topic for this blog post.

## S1lkpay

**S1lkpay** is a secure and convenient digital wallet and payment app that simplifies your financial transactions. It is very much like the EWallets that we have in the *Philippines* like Maya and GCash.

With **S1lkpay** we bypass this digital restriction that the BSP imposes on our local banks, giving us a way to fund our **Apple Wallet**.

## Downloading S1lkpay and Creating an Account

In the App Store, you should be able to find the S1lkpay App.

## Prerequisite Option Before Setting Up S1lkpay and Apple Wallet

**Apple Wallet** is legally still not available in the *Philippines* so we have to do a simple workaround for that.

### Steps

1. Go to Settings > General

## Installing and Setting up S1lkpay

8. It will then show the Payment page, I'd recommend using a SeaBank Debit Card as its the only payment method I have tried that actually worked.

9. After setting up your S1lk card, it should show an option to add the card to your **Apple Wallet**.

10. After you've added your S1lk card it should show in your **Apple Wallet** app inside your iPhone and your Apple Watch.
